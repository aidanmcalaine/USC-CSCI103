NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

================================ Questions ==================================

1. Did you use the 'suit', 'type' and 'value' arrays? What functions are easier
to implement when using these arrays? How do you use them?

:Yes, I used each of these arrays, and they made all of my functions other than main and shuffle easier to implement. 
They made it easy to obtain the correct values for each suit, type, and value (as are their names). 
2. Did you add any additional functions to your implementation? If so briefly
describe how the functions improved your solution.

:I did not add any additional functions. 

3. There are many ways to shuffle the deck of cards. The method used in our
implementation generates a permutaion of the cards to shuffle. For an array of
size N, how many swap (exchange) operations does this algorithm do? Does the
algorithm require any extra memory to generate a permutation?

:Our algorithm should swap (n-1) times. The algorithm does require extra memory to generate a 
permutation because we need to declare temporary variables.
